[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/openlaw.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/openlaw)

The OpenLaw JavaScript APIs allow you to integrate and build on the OpenLaw protocol.

The class `APIClient` library is an interface for querying, saving, and changing data in an OpenLaw instance as well as for user authentication. The interface serves as a convenient wrapper to the OpenLaw REST API.

The `Openlaw` object library is an interface to interact directly with an OpenLaw legal agreement and its contents, including its various variable types.

## Documentation

Check out the guide for getting started, the complete reference for using the OpenLaw JavaScript APIs, and other information about how to use the OpenLaw application at our [docs](https://docs.openlaw.io/).

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install openlaw --save
```

## Example Usage

### `APIClient`

const {APIClient} = require('openlaw');
// ES2015 modules
import {APIClient} from 'openlaw';

// Include the root URL for the OpenLaw instance.
apiClient = new APIClient('https://app.openlaw.io');

/*
Most of the APIClient method calls can only be made by a logged in
user with a StandardUser role or an Admin role. Log in before making
those calls.
*/
apiClient.login('openlawuser+1@gmail.com', 'password');

apiClient.getTemplate('Advisor Agreement').then(result => {
  console.log(result);
});
